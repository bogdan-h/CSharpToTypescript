# CSharpToTypescript

----

**Original Repository:  joao-neves95/CSharpToTypescript forked from https://github.com/nhabuiduc/TypescriptSyntaxPaste**

Modified the library and built a small application that will : 
 1. Parse a folders and all of the subfoldes and generate TypeScript files from C# files.<br/>
   If the transpiler will encounter any error - the file will still be generated and the file name will contain the '-error' in the name.
 2. Open a windows form where the C# code can be pasted and after clicking on 'Convert' button either the code will be transpiled or an error will be shown.</br>
   In the same manner the converted code or an error will replace the pasted code.

The application is a quick-and-dirty implementation.
